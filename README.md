# Common error in TypeScript: the use of the throw statement to handle errors

This code demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: the use of the throw statement to handle errors. The throw statement stops execution of the function and returns control to the calling function. This is problematic because there is no way to continue execution after the throw statement and handle the error.

## Solution

Instead of using the throw statement, use a try-catch block to handle errors. This allows you to continue execution after an error occurs. The try-catch block is more robust than using a throw statement alone.
